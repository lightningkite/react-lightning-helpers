# Contributing to the Docs

These docs are generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and change into the docs directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lightningkite/react-lightning-helpers.git
cd react-lightning-helpers/docs
```

Install mkdocs and the Material theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Serve the docs locally on port 8000 with hot reloading:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Adding a New Page

To add a new page, create a new markdown file in the `docs` directory, then add it to the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yml`

## Publishing

```bash

```
